=============================
Verifying reference existence
=============================

It is not so easy to verify a class implements an attribute as a
reference as their usage is transparent.

References
==========

Let's build an example interface and class using a reference:

>>> import zope.interface
>>> import gocept.reference
>>> import zope.annotation.interfaces
>>> class IAddress(zope.interface.Interface):
...     city = zope.interface.Attribute("City the address belonges to.")
>>> class Address(object):
...     zope.interface.implements(
...         zope.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable, IAddress)
...     city = gocept.reference.Reference()

verifyClass does not check for attributes:

>>> import zope.interface.verify
>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyClass(IAddress, Address)
True

verifyObject tells that the object does not completly fulfill the
interface:

>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(IAddress, Address())
Traceback (most recent call last):
BrokenImplementation: An object has failed to implement interface <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IAddress>
The city attribute was not provided.

Setting a value on the reference attribute does not help because after
that it ist not possible to check if there is a reference as the
reference is transparent. Even worse, a class which does not define
the required attribute and an instance thereof with the attribute set,
lets the test pass without defining the reference at all:

>>> class AddressWithoutReference(object):
...     zope.interface.implements(IAddress)
>>> address_without_ref = AddressWithoutReference()
>>> address_without_ref.city = None
>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(IAddress, address_without_ref)
True

So we need a special verifyObject function which does a check on the
class if there is a missing attribute:

>>> import gocept.reference.verify
>>> gocept.reference.verify.verifyObject(IAddress, Address())
True

This function is not fully fool proof because it also works with the
instance which has the attribute set. The reason for this behavior is
that the interface does not tell that the attribute must be
implemented as a reference:

>>> gocept.reference.verify.verifyObject(IAddress, address_without_ref)
True

But if the attribute which does not exist on the instance does not
have a reference descriptior on the class the gocept.reference's
verifyObject can detect this:

>>> class StrangeAddress(object):
...     zope.interface.implements(IAddress)
...     @property
...     def city(self):
...         raise AttributeError
>>> strange_address = StrangeAddress()
>>> gocept.reference.verify.verifyObject(IAddress, strange_address)
Traceback (most recent call last):
BrokenImplementation: An object has failed to implement interface <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IAddress>
The city attribute was not provided.

Like ``zope.interface.verify.verifyObject`` detects, too:

>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(IAddress, strange_address)
Traceback (most recent call last):
BrokenImplementation: An object has failed to implement interface <InterfaceClass __builtin__.IAddress>
The city attribute was not provided.


Reference collections
=====================

Reference collections suffer the same problem when checked with
zope.inferface.verify.verfyObject:

>>> class ICity(zope.interface.Interface):
...     cultural_institutions = zope.interface.Attribute(
...         "Cultural institutions the city has.")
>>> class City(object):
...     zope.interface.implements(
...         zope.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable, ICity)
...     cultural_institutions = gocept.reference.ReferenceCollection()

>>> zope.interface.verify.verifyObject(ICity, City())
Traceback (most recent call last):
BrokenImplementation: An object has failed to implement interface <InterfaceClass __builtin__.ICity>
The cultural_institutions attribute was not provided.

But the special variant in gocept.reference works for collections, too:

>>> gocept.reference.verify.verifyObject(ICity, City())
True
