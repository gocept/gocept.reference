>>> import zope.site.hooks

gocept.reference 0.5.2 had a consistency bug: Causing a TypeError by trying to
assign a non-collection to a ReferenceCollection attribute would break
integrity enforcement for that attribute while keeping its previously assigned
value. This is how it should work:

>>> halle.cultural_institutions = set((theatre,))
>>> del root['theatre']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.

>>> halle.cultural_institutions = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: 1 can't be assigned as a reference collection: only sets are allowed.

>>> halle.cultural_institutions
InstrumentedSet([u'/theatre'])

>>> del root['theatre']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.


In version 0.7, a bug was found that caused attempts to unreference targets
that weren't registered in the first place when using reference sets without
integrity enforcement. With or without the latter, targets should be both
assignable and addable to and removable from reference collections any number
of times:

>>> halle.cultural_institutions = set()
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.add(theatre)
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.add(theatre)
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)
>>> halle.cultural_institutions = set((theatre,))
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)
>>> halle.cultural_institutions = set((theatre,))
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)

>>> from gocept.reference.testing import Village
>>> dorf = root['dorf'] = Village()
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions = set()
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions.add(theatre)
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions.add(theatre)
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions = set((theatre,))
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions = set((theatre,))
>>> dorf.cultural_institutions.remove(theatre)

The same implementation bug prevented deletion of objects that were contained
in a reference set when it was assigned to more than one integrity-ensured
ReferenceCollection attribute, but removed from it later. This should work:

>>> zoo = root['zoo'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> halle.cultural_institutions = set([zoo])
>>> leipzig = root['leipzig'] = City()
>>> leipzig.cultural_institutions = halle.cultural_institutions
>>> halle.cultural_institutions.remove(zoo)
>>> leipzig.cultural_institutions
InstrumentedSet([])
>>> del root['zoo']

Up to version 0.9, reference descriptors could not find out their attribute
names when read from the class even though there was integrity ensurance code
that relied on doing just that:

>>> from gocept.reference.testing import Address
>>> Address.city.__name__ = None  # reset
>>> Address.city.__name__
'city'

Also up to 0.9, the algorithm for digging up the attribute name of a reference
descriptor on a class would not handle references inherited from a base class:

>>> from gocept.reference.testing import Address
>>> class InheritedAddress(Address):
...     pass
>>> Address.city.__name__ = None
>>> InheritedAddress.city.__name__
'city'
