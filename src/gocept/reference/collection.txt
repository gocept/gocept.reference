=====================
Reference collections
=====================

To have an attribute of an object reference multiple other objects using a
collection you can use a ReferenceCollection property.

A collection behaves like a set and manages references while objects are added
or removed from the set:

>>> import zope.site.hooks
>>> root = getRootFolder()
>>> zope.site.hooks.setSite(root)

We need a class defining a ReferenceCollection. (Importing the class
from the test module is necassary to persist instances of the class):

>>> from zope.container.contained import Contained
>>> import gocept.reference
>>> import zope.interface
>>> from zope.annotation.interfaces import IAttributeAnnotatable

>>> class City(Contained):
...     zope.interface.implements(IAttributeAnnotatable)
...     cultural_institutions = gocept.reference.ReferenceCollection(
...         ensure_integrity=True)
>>> from gocept.reference.testing import City

Initially, the collection isn't set and accessing it causes an
AttributeError:

>>> halle = City()
>>> halle.cultural_institutions
Traceback (most recent call last):
AttributeError: cultural_institutions

So we define some cultural institutions:

>>> class CulturalInstitution(Contained):
...     title = None
>>> from gocept.reference.testing import CulturalInstitution

>>> root['theatre'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> root['cinema'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> root['park'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> import transaction
>>> transaction.commit()

Trying to set an individual value instead of a collection, raises a
TypeError:

>>> halle.cultural_institutions = root['park']
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> can't be assigned as a reference collection: only sets are allowed.


Managing whole sets
===================

Assigning a set works:

>>> halle.cultural_institutions = set([root['park'], root['cinema']])
>>> len(halle.cultural_institutions)
2
>>> list(halle.cultural_institutions)
[<gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>,
 <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>]

As `halle` isn't located yet, the integrity ensurance doesn't notice
referenced objects being deleted:

>>> del root['cinema']

The result is a broken reference:

>>> list(halle.cultural_institutions)
Traceback (most recent call last):
LookupError: Reference target u'/cinema' no longer exists.

Also, we can not locate `halle` right now, as long as the reference is broken:

>>> root['halle'] = halle
Traceback (most recent call last):
LookupError: Reference target u'/cinema' no longer exists.

The transaction was doomed, so we abort:

>>> transaction.abort()

Unfortunately, the `abort` doesn't roll-back the attributes of Halle because it
wasn't part of the transaction yet (as it couldn't be added to the database).
We need to clean up manually, otherwise the next assignment won't raise any
events:

>>> halle.__name__ = None
>>> halle.__parent__ = None

The cinema is back now, and Halle is in an operational state again:

>>> list(halle.cultural_institutions)
[<gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>,
 <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>]

Now we can add it to the database:

>>> root['halle'] = halle

And deleting a referenced object will cause an error:

>>> del root['cinema']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.

When we remove the referencing collection, the target can be deleted again:

>>> halle.cultural_institutions = None
>>> del root['cinema']

Managing individual items of sets
=================================

Note: We did not implement the set API 100%. We'll add methods as we need
them.

In addition to changing sets by assigning complete new sets, we can modify the
sets with individual items just as the normal `set` API allows us to do.

We'll start out with an empty set:

>>> root['jena'] = City()
>>> root['jena'].cultural_institutions = set()

Our reference engine turns this set into a different object which manages the
references:

>>> ci = root['jena'].cultural_institutions
>>> ci
InstrumentedSet([])

We can add new references, by adding objects to this set and the referenced
integrity is ensured:

>>> ci.add(root['park'])
>>> del root['park']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.

Removing and discarding works:

>>> ci.remove(root['park'])
>>> del root['park']
>>> root['park'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> ci.add(root['park'])
>>> del root['park']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.
>>> ci.discard(root['park'])
>>> del root['park']
>>> ci.discard(root['halle'])

Clearing works:

>>> ci.add(root['theatre'])
>>> del root['theatre']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.
>>> ci.clear()
>>> len(ci)
0
>>> del root['theatre']

>>> root['cinema'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> root['cinema'].title = 'Cinema'
>>> ci.add(root['cinema'])
>>> del root['cinema']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.
>>> ci.pop().title
'Cinema'
>>> del root['cinema']

Updating works:

>>> root['cinema'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> root['theatre'] = CulturalInstitution()
>>> ci.update([root['cinema'], root['theatre']])
>>> len(ci)
2
>>> del root['cinema']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.
>>> del root['theatre']
Traceback (most recent call last):
IntegrityError: Can't delete or move <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...>. The (sub-)object <gocept.reference.testing.CulturalInstitution object at 0x...> is still being referenced.
