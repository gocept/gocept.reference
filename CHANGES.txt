- Extended the API for `IReferenceTarget.is_referenced` to allow specifying
  whether to query for references recursively or only on a specific object.
  By default the query is recursive. 

- Fixed bug in the event handler for enforcing ensured constraints: referenced
  objects could be deleted if they were deleted together with a parent
  location.
