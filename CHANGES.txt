0.5.2 (2008-10-16)
==================

- Fixed: When upgrading gocept.reference to version 0.5.1, a
  duplication error was raised.


0.5.1 (2008-10-10)
==================

- Made sure that the reference manager is installed using
  zope.app.generations before packages depending on gocept.reference.

0.5 (2008-09-11)
================

- Added specialized variant of zope.interface.verify.verifyObject
  which can handle references and reference collections correctly.


0.4 (2008-09-08)
================

- Moved InstrumentedSet to use BTree data structures for better performance.

- Added `update` method to InstrumentedSet.

- Updated documentation.


0.3 (2008-04-22)
================

- Added a `set` implementation for referencing collections of objects.

0.2 (2007-12-21)
================

- Extended the API for `IReferenceTarget.is_referenced` to allow specifying
  whether to query for references recursively or only on a specific object.
  By default the query is recursive. 

- Fixed bug in the event handler for enforcing ensured constraints: referenced
  objects could be deleted if they were deleted together with a parent
  location.

0.1 (2007-12-20)
================

Initial release.
